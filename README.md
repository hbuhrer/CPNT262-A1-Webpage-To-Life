## Bugs and Issues

- Bug Edit (Mar 6, 2024): My js script for removing hover on touch devices is not working on some mobile browsers (Safari), and there is a good solution to be implemented here: 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23885255/how-to-remove-ignore-hover-css-style-on-touch-devices 

Will implement the detect touch via JS and prepend CSS :hover rules using a class like body.hasHover when possible to fix this issue the right way. - HB

Nothing significant other than a missed draw call from v1 of the matrix js effect that was making it reload like crazy when scrolling on mobile, removing that mitigated the issue, but will still get a reload when the animation hits the top of a mobile device. This is an open issue that will be fixed before production. I also had to add:

body::selection {
    background-color: transparent;
    color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);
  }

because the darkmode checkbox toggle was highlighting the nav bar if you clicked too fast. The solution worked and this issue is now closed.
